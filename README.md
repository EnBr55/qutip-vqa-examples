# Qutip-VQA-Examples

This repository is for usage examples of [my suggested VQA implementation in QuTiP](https://github.com/EnBr55/qutip-qip).

## Usage

To test out these notebooks, you'll need the `qutip` package installed, and you'll need to install `qutip-qip` from my fork. To do this:
- Clone my forked repository: `git clone https://github.com/EnBr55/qutip-qip`
- `cd qutip-qip` into the repository
- `pip install -e .` to install the package from the cloned repository.

After these steps, all examples from this repository should run as intended.
